- I'm interested in Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Signal and Speech Processing.
- Iâ€™m currently working on building end-to-end Speech Recognition systems.
- I'm also passionate about Market Research and DataViz apps.
- Also working on Trade Signal analysis in different markets, having previously worked on Indian and American stock markets (Check out TradeSignalSentiment).
- Want to learn basics of Computer Vision? Check out the repo Image_Processing_interactive!
- Check out my Dynamic Gesture Recognition Platform: AirInteract.
- Searching for Data Cleaning and Preprocessing tools? Check out my python package MAHA on pypi. The downloads are 'OVER 9000!' (Any Vegeta fans out here?)
- For Kaldi Speech Recognition recipes, check AssameseASR and TamilASR.
- Check out my submission to McGill University McMedHacks Medical Imaging and Deep Learning Hackathon, that my team won in 2 categories, check out DIME and AlphaTauSeed.
